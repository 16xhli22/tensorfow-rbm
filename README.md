# rbm-tf
Tensorflow implementation of Restricted Boltzman Machine and Autoencoder for layerwise pretraining of Deep Autoencoders with RBM.

More in this paper:

I was inspired with these implementations but need to refactor them and improve them(thanks):

I used similar api for RBM and Autoencoder classes to models from official tensorflow/models.

Feel free to make updates, repairs...!

Check test-au.py and test-rbm.py for usages!
